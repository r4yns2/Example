    <h1>1.0 World Wide Web</h1>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
      system where documents and other web recources are identified by Uniform
      Resource Locators(URLs, such as http://example.com/), which may be
      interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the internet[1][2] The
      resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
      (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web
      browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
      The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated
      the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the
      Web is built.

    <h2>1.1 history</h2>
    <p>
      The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from
      the 1960s, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University,
      Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS).
      Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's
      microfilm-based memex, which was described in the 1945 essay "As We May
      Think".[12] Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information
      system became a possibility by the second half of the 1980s.[13] By 1985,
      the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name
      System (upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built) came into being.
      In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America
      was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a
      web-like system at CERN.[14]

    <h3>1.2 Function</h3>
    <p>
      The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much
      distinction. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The
      Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In
      contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other
      resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are accessed using
      HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the
      Internet's transport protocols.[41]
    </p>
    <h4>1.2.1 HTML</h4>
    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
      and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World
      Wide Web.[43]
    </p>
    <h5>1.2.2 Linking</h5>
    <p>
      Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to
      downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources.
      In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:
      <a href="http://example.org/home.html">Example.org Homepage</a>
    </p>
    <h6>1.2.3 WWW prefix</h6>
    <p>
      Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with www because of the
      long-standing practice of naming Internet hosts according to the services
      they provide. The hostname of a web server is often www, in the same way
      that it may be ftp for an FTP server, and news or nntp for a Usenet news
      server.

    <h1>2.0 Internet</h1>
    <p>
      The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer
      networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate
      between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of
      private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to
      global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical
      networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information
      resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and
      applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and
      file sharing.
    </p>
    <h2>2.1 Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or
      interwoven.[7] The word Internet was used in 1974 as the shorthand form of
      Internetwork.[8] Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the
      global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also
      refer to any group of smaller networks.[9]

    <h3>2.2 History</h3>
    <p>
      In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United
      States Department of Defense funded research into time-sharing of
      computers.[14][15][16] Research into packet switching, one of the
      fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran in
      the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965.[1][17] After
      the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching
      from the proposed NPL network was incorporated into the design for the
      ARPANET and other resource sharing networks such as the Merit Network and
      CYCLADES, which were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]
