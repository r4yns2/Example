    <h2>Let's play</h2>

      I have had a very tough life. My father despites me. Many people tried to
      murder me during my whole life. Among them, my sister, after being falsely
      accused of poisoning my nephew. I was lucky then, and my brother saved me.
      Since then, I have lived in exile and now I serve the enemy of my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may remember what I said at my trial, when I was falsely accused of
      killing my nephew, the King: "I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime:
      I'm guilty of being a dwarf!
    </p>
    <p><strong>Who</strong> am I?</p>
