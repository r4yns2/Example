      <abbr title="Oh my god">OMG!</abbr> After reading
      <cite> Short History of Nearly Everything</cite> by Bill Bryson, I
      realized how like humans are. Read what he wrote in his book:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        thank goodness for atoms. But the fact that you have atoms and that they
        assemble in such a willing manner is only part of what got you here. To
        be here now, alive in the twenty-first century and smart enough to know
        it, you also had to be the beneficiary of an extraordinary string of
        biological good fortune. Survival on Earth is a surprisingly tricky
        business. Of the billions and billions of species of living thing that
        have existed since the dawn of time, most-99.99 percent-are no longer
        around. Life on Earth, you see, is not only brief but dismayingly
        tenuous. It is a curious feature of our existence that we come from a
        planet that is very good at promoting life but even better at
        extinguishing it.
      </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time immemorial
        to a favored evolutionary line, but you have also been extremely-make
        that miraculously-fortunate in your personal ancestry. Consider the fact
        that for 3.8 billion years, a period of time older than the Earth's
        mountains and rivers and oceans, every one of your forebears on both
        sides has been attractive enough to find a mate, healthy enough to
        reproduce, and sufficiently blessed by fate and circumstances to live
        long enough to do so. Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed,
        devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or
        otherwise deflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny charge of
        genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to
        perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that
        could result-eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly-in you.
