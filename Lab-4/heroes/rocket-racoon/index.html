              Known for his snarky, trigger-happy personality, Rocket Raccoon
              first appeared 10,000 years in the future as a mysteriously
              helpful, if not annoying, woodland creature on planet Hailailae.
              Since then—or maybe before then—he has become the most well-known

          <p>The Ranger</p>

          <p>
            A native of the Keystone Quadrant, Rocket Raccoon began his life as
            a protector of an unidentified humanoid race known as the Loonies.
            They came to the planet hundreds of years prior when psychiatrists,
            searching for a place to house and study their criminally insane
            away from the contempt of everyday society, founded an asylum on
            planet Halfworld. Wanting their new environment to be as friendly as
            possible, the founders brought furry creatures to comfort their
            patients while they built robots to help care for them. For years,
            the psychiatrists studied patients on Halfworld before returning
            home and leaving their patients under the sole care of the remaining
            robots. As time passed the robots became sentient and longed to
            leave Halfworld. They genetically engineered the Earth-like animals,
            creating humanized caretakers to function in their stead, and
            withdrew to build a ship capable of breaking through the force field
            surrounding the planet—another security measure left behind by the
            founders.
