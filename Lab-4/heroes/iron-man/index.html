            Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons
            manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Tony grew up a genius
            with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally,
            followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon
            his parents’ untimely death. Tony designed many weapons of war for
            Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating,
            while living the lifestyle of an irresponsible playboy
          </p>

          <p>
            Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark once he decided to
            consult on a weapons contract overseas in enemy terrain. An
            improvised explosive device exploded underneath Tony’s transport,
            and he was brought to the brink of death.
          </p>

          <p>
            Awakening as a prisoner of the warlord Wong-Chu, Tony made a
            gruesome discovery: the explosion had sent a piece of shrapnel mere
            inches from his heart. It was only the timely intervention of fellow
            captive and engineer Yinsen that kept the shrapnel at bay.While held
            captive, and forced to work on weapons, Tony turned his near-death
            experience into inspiration. What if he could power an iron suit
            that would not only keep the shrapnel from killing Tony, but also
            help him to escape?
