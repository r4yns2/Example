              Scientist Bruce Banner’s inner turmoil transforms him into the
              mean, green rage machine called the Hulk.

            <p>The Monster Inside</p>

            <p>
              The child of an abusive father, Bruce Banner grew up shy and
              introverted, yet a scientific genius. As a young man, thanks to
              his standout work in the field of nuclear physics, he attracted
              the attention of the U.S. Army who wanted to adapt his theories
              for weaponry. Banner resisted such notions, but failed attempts at
              landing steady work convinced him to accept a position at a
              federal nuclear research facility at a missile base in the New
              Mexico desert.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the base, Banner was befriended by Betty Ross, daughter of
              General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, a man who took an instant
              disliking to the diminutive, passive scientist. While at the base,
              Banner began to develop and build a bomb that utilized a high
              concentration of gamma radiation, a project of high interest to an
              undercover foreign agent stationed there. When a teenager named
              Rick Jones wandered onto the test field just as Banner started the
              countdown for the gamma bomb’s initial test detonation, the
              scientist rushed out to the area to warn Jones, but the foreign
              agent purposefully continued the test. The bomb exploded, bathing
              Bruce Banner in its radiation.
