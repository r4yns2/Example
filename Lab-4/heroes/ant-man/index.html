            Desperate to provide for his family, but unable to make ends meet,
            electronics genius Scott Lang turned to burglary and inadvertently
            won himself a prison sentence. After being released early for good
            behavior, he knuckled down to raise his daughter Cassie, though soon
            discovered nothing had changed with his luck and fortunes. When
            Cassie fell ill from a devastating heart ailment and her surgeon was
            abducted by a mysterious wealthy man, Lang reluctantly returned to
            his life of crime in an effort to save his daughter’s life.

          <p>
            Assuming scientist Hank Pym’s home might offer expensive equipment
            to pawn for cash, Lang broke in, but discovered something far more
            valuable—unbeknownst to him, he was staring his future in the face.
            He left the home with Pym’s old Ant-Man gear and uniform, left over
            from the scientist’s early days as a Super Hero with the Avengers,
            and set out to use it to rescue Cassie’s surgeon.

            Almost anything can be used as a link, however, you have a couple of limitations.
            Links and anchors defined by the A element must not be nested; an A element must not contain any other A elements.
